#### Learning curves of GAIL
We provide two formats of the learning curves, i.e., the 'png' format and the 'pdf' format. The '.pdf' version is in the higher resolution. The legend ''GAILTraj{$x$}'' means that $x$ expert trajectories are used to train GAIL, and $d_0$ is the cost limit for the expert data.
